## Introduction

Super Auto Pets is a popular turn-based auto-battler game where players build teams of animals with unique abilities and stats to compete against other teams. 
ASAP aims to automate the gameplay and provide a platform for developing intelligent agents.

Auto Super-Auto-Pets (ASAP) is a work-in-progress that aims to provide:
- A simulated environment to run and play Super Auto Pets.
- A reinforcement learning (RL) environment wrapper to facilitate the integration of RL algorithms.
- Tools and scripts to train, evaluate, and optimize ML agents.
